This is a cookbook for managing RabbitMQ with Chef.  It has sane defaults, but can also be configured via attributes.  It is quite useful as is, but has two areas for improvement:

1) While it can create cluster configuration files, it does not currently do the dance to join the cluster members to each other.

2) The Erlang run parameters are currently an opaque string.  They should really be a set of tunables to be manipulated by name.

Share and enjoy!
